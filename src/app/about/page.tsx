          <h2><strong>Track</strong></h2>
          <p>
            At the core of Gobizzâ€™s functionality is a robust tracking system that meticulously monitors 
            every movement within your inventory. From the moment ingredients enter your storage to 
            the precise usage in your kitchen, our platform logs every transaction in real time. 
            This comprehensive tracking provides you with accurate data on stock levels, expiration dates, 
            and usage patterns, helping you make proactive decisions. With detailed analytics and timely alerts, 
            our tracking system not only prevents shortages and overstock situations but also supports you in 
            optimizing your overall operational efficiency, ensuring that your culinary creations are always 
            backed by precise and reliable data.
